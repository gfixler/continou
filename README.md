# continou
Companion code to my talk "[Finite Flights on an Infinite Plane](http://www.meetup.com/santa-monica-haskell/events/227156054/)."

This talk was inspired by Conal Elliott's explanation of images as continuous functions in his wonderful Lambda Jam 2015 talk "[Denotational Design: From Meanings To Programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmKYiUOEo2A)." Conal's talk is filled with rigor, and great information about the formal semantics underlying continuous images; my talk is a non-rigorous dive into building some fun things with and for my local Haskell meetup group.

I have (and am) making some tweaks and additions to the code seen in the talk (video thereof to be posted soon). I had some good suggestions from the audience, and there were some things I got wrong, and didn't have time before or during the talk to address. I did mistakenly delete the live-coded code in its entirety, immediately following the talk, but it's mostly identical to this repo, which I built in the lead-up to the talk, and then used, viewing diffs commit-by-commit on a second laptop during the talk (thanks Jake!), in order to remember (and get right) each next addition or transformation of the code that I intended to demonstrate. It was a little hectic at first, but ultimately worked out better than I feared.
