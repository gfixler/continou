Companion code to my talk "Finite Flights on an Infinite Plane," presented on April 14th, 2016, to the Santa Monica Haskell Meetup Group.

This talk was inspired by Conal Elliott's explanation of images as continuous functions in his wonderful Lambda Jam 2015 talk "[Denotational Design: From Meanings To Programs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmKYiUOEo2A)." Conal's talk is filled with rigor, and great information about the formal semantics underlying continuous images; my talk is a non-rigorous dive into building some fun things with and for my local Haskell meetup group.
